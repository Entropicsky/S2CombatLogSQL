- [x] Set up virtual environment and dependencies
- [x] Initial data inspection of combat logs
- [x] Define key data types and events in logs
- [x] Create draft schema for relational database
- [x] Develop sample data transformation functions

## Phase 2: Database Design

- [x] Define SQLAlchemy ORM models for entities
- [x] Create database connection/session management
- [x] Implement database initialization
- [x] Create base models for different event types
- [x] Add relationship definitions between models
- [x] Add indexes for performance optimization
- [x] Test basic CRUD operations on models

## Phase 3: Parser Implementation

- [x] Create configuration module
- [x] Implement data transformation functions
- [x] Create combat log reader and parser
- [x] Implement entity and event extraction
- [x] Create batch processing functionality 
- [x] Add error handling and logging
- [x] Implement derived statistics calculation
- [x] Create specialized transformers for different event types
- [x] Add timeline event generation
- [x] Optimize parser for performance

## Phase 4: CLI and Testing

- [x] Implement command-line interface 
- [x] Add test fixtures and sample data
- [x] Create tests for transformers
- [x] Create tests for database models
- [x] Implement tests for parser functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

## Phase 5: Documentation and Packaging

- [ ] Document database schema
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Add typing for all modules
- [ ] Implement packaging and distribution
- [ ] Create usage examples

## Future Phases (Not in Current Scope)
- [ ] Create visualization tools
- [ ] Build analytics dashboard
- [ ] Implement multi-match analysis capabilities
- [ ] Develop match comparison features

## Bug Fixes

- [x] Fix the timestamp format parsing in the `parse_timestamp` function to properly handle log file formats `YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM.SS` (2025.03.19-04.09.28)
- [x] Fix null field issues in the database (match_id, timestamp, location_x, location_y)
- [x] Fix inconsistent timestamp/event_time field usage across transformers
- [ ] Handle malformed JSON in log files - currently gets warning but could be improved
